# Emile's Project 2: Music Box

This is project was born out of an interest to make digital versions of
simple mechanical instruments with the concepts we learnt in class over the
semester. The goal was to create a digital script that would do the same
task as it's physical counterpart, in this case I decided to recreate the
music box. The user would load various music sheets specifically designed
for the program, said program would then decode the selected music sheet
and play it back for the user. The music sheet template simple, easy to
read as well as being easily modifiable using any drawing or photo editing
software. I wanted to capture the creative process of making your own music
sheets to enter it in and see what the music box plays even if it doesn't  
always sound the way you expected it to. It is also visually similar to its
physical counterpart: the canvas shows the strings a physical music box
would have and the music sheet images have their information stored, read
and modified along the same method of rows and staffs.
